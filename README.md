This project aims to develop an image classification algorithm utilizing a neural network. The data is sourced from the CIFAR10 dataset which in itself is a subset of 50000 labeled images taken out of the 80 million tiny images dataset colected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. Details of this dataset are described in the following report:
